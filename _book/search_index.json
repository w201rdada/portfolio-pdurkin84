Abstract of my first cool idea Foreign investment in frontier markets, including several Middle Eastern countries, are often seen as higher risk due to several factors, one of which is the reliability and availability of economic data. Poor quality data are disadvantageous to potential investors, and other stakeholders as well as the countries seeking foreign investment. Middle East countries are relatively wealthy with strong consumer spending and a shift to online spending means that there is more private online data available to create independent, verifiable economic data, including consumer price indices, which would help investors and other stakeholders make better economic and financial decisions. Abstract of my second cool idea A sad fact to anyone suffering from a degenerative neurological disease, such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) or ALS, is that they will lose their voice eventually. To lessen this impact of these diseases, our idea is to design a tool, building on current technology and incorporating data science concepts that will improve the patient’s quality of life near the end stages of the disease. About the author The author is a long in the tooth technology acolyte who has had many areas of specialty over a varied career. Updated: 2017-11-26 "],
["reliablemacrodata.html", "Improving Data in Frontier Markets: Creating Independent Consumer Price Index", " Improving Data in Frontier Markets: Creating Independent Consumer Price Index Keywords Middle East, Frontier Markets, Macroeconomic data, CPI, Frontier markets: limited by poor data? Many Middle Eastern countries have limited data sets, collected over a much shorter period. While basic economic statistics are collected by these countries, they may be considered unreliable, inadequate and untimely by external investors and stakeholders wanting to make informed economic and financial decisions. Several Middle East countries are considered to be frontier markets by investment classifications (such as the S&amp;P), classified below emerging markets as they are too small to meet the criteria. While they may be small, many of these countries are relatively wealthy with GDP per capita significantly greater than emerging economies and close to some developed countries. Several Middle East countries such as Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are classified at frontier economies. While these countries are relatively wealthy (often due to natural resources), their statistical agencies are underdeveloped, and there is not enough good reliable economic data. As a result, investors and other stakeholders such as non-profit agencies, development and aid agencies, may not have full information about these countries economies to make informed financial and economic decisions. Creating independent, timely datasets To help investors and other stakeholders make better decisions about frontier markets economies, we will provide an independent collection and presentation of the consumer price data that will be produced on a monthly basis. We will focus initially on prices, attempting to create an independent consumer price index (CPI), used to calculate the inflation rate. (CPI is price index comprised of a typical basket of goods and services including food, services, and transport.) The first step will be to create price baskets of goods and services for the countries covered. Given the wealth in the region, consumers are a strong part of the economy and online shopping is starting to take off. Recently, two major grocery stores in the region moved to online platforms. Amazon bought a local online shopping site. While service prices are more complicated, things like tuition can be easily scraped from school websites, and rent and used auto prices from local on-line sites, similar to Craigslist. We will implement a weekly scrape of the sites and begin a database of product and service prices. Given the multi-cultural makeup of these countries and the vast disparity between incomes classes, it will be prudent to create multiple baskets reflecting typical buying patterns within the groups. Knowledge of the countries cultures and traditions, which impact consumers decisions and pricing trends, could be added to the analysis. Better data, better decisions Once completed, we will have an independent verification of the data presented by each nation, which can be compared alongside the official government statistics. These independent data could help give stakeholders more confidence on how these economies are performing. However, there will still be some uncertainty as some data that would typically be easily collected in other countries, for example, things like transport and healthcare, could not be gleaned from the internet. Moreover, to assure investors that the index is not a “black box”, we would be transparent in the data calculations, data set, and assumptions. There is also a time lag between implementing the new index and being able to be able to derive meaningful analysis. At least several years of data points are needed to see trends and turning points. Finally, this can be implemented for any nation but would be especially useful in frontier and emerging markets where there is less surety of unbiased government publications but still plenty of online data to use for validation. There is also a collaborative aspect as many of these countries are being opened to foreign investors. For example, Dubai is hosting Expo 2020 and is keen to increase its profile as an attractive investment destination. Saudi Arabia recently released its Vision 2030, a blueprint of increasing economic growth, focused on attracting foreign investors. Some major foreign investors could potentially fund the project given that it would benefit them outright. "],

Some diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD), ALS and Motor Neuron Disease have symptoms that include the loss of the person’s voice as the disease progresses. As described by Professor Stephen Hawking, the loss of his voice due to his motor neuron disease is “one of the most frightening and isolating aspects of the illness”. Current technology provides some support for these patients: for example, devices that provide voice amplification or alternative input methods (where keyboards are manipulated by whatever muscles are still under control of the user). Our idea is to use a combination of existing technologies to create a seamless solution that will amplify a patient’s deteriorating speech with their own voice and vocabulary. Return of voice: lost voice synthesis Advances in technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and voice synthesis can be used to measure a patient’s voice and reproduce it even after it has become too silent or slurred to be understood. In the earlier stages of these diseases, while the individual can communicate effectively, discrete sensors on and around the body can be used to record the movements of muscles and face, sounds, and vibrations in the throat. The goal is to create a database of the patient’s typical speech patterns and vocabulary, building a “language model” similar to that built by the SwiftKey team for Professor Stephen Hawking. Millions, if not billions, of data points, will be stored in a machine learning system that will be able to determine, not just how the person’s body forms the words but also their vocabulary, colloquialisms and the sound of their voice. The system will also learn the changes in voice patterns as the disease progresses. In the later stages of the disease, when the patient’s voice fades, a function to enhance their voice is enabled, allowing the user to remain in communication with the world around them. We also believe that the machine learning algorithm may support the loss of verbal fluency (forgetting words) that is common in PD, with the solution predicting words based on conversation context and previous usage. The impact The implementation of this system will require a diverse skill set to design the best solution for gathering and analyzing the data, building a language model, and finally optimizing the enhancement for the patient to use in the later stages of the disease. For example, an optimal wearable device needs to be created, ensuring the design does not impede the wearer’s lifestyle (particularly while they are still active). Also, once the patient needs the enhancement function, the latency between vocalization and playing the enhancement needs to be near real-time. Currently, the solution may not work for all sufferers, as towards the end of some of these diseases it may no longer be possible to read the signals from the patient. At that point, the system can switch to the traditional alternative-input methods. However, the learned voice synthesis, speech patterns and vocabulary can continue to be utilized allowing the person to speak with their own voice and words. Our solution also may lend itself to future innovations such as brain-computer interface (BCI), which could be leveraged to interface with the system. While experiencing a disease that causes loss of voice is never going to be easy for the patient, this tailored and customizable solution could have a positive psychological and meaningful impact on quality of life for suffers of degenerative neurological diseases.
