Imagine you are told that in the future you will stop talking.  You will never again share a joke, advise your children or tell your spouse that you love them.  Some diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD), ALS and Motor Neuron Disease have symptoms that include the loss of the person’s voice as the disease progresses.  As described by Professor Stephen Hawking about his Motor Neuron disease, the loss of voice is “one of the most frightening and isolating aspects of the illness”.

Current technology has some support, for example, voice amplification or alternative input methods (where keyboards are manipulated by whatever muscles are still under control of the user).  But what if we could make the input methods seamless?


## We can give you back your voice

Advances in technologies such as machine learning, big data, natural language processing and voice synthesis can be used to measure a patients voice and reproduce it even after it has become too silent or slurred to be understood.  In the earlier stages of these diseases, while the individual can communicate effectively, sensors on and around their body can be used to record the movements of muscles and face, sounds, and vibrations in the throat.

The solution can record typical and known vocabulary, building a “language model” similar to that built by the SwiftKey team for Professor Stephen Hawking.  Millions, if not billions, of data points will be stored in a big data machine learning system that will be able to determine, not just how the person’s body forms the words, but also their vocabulary, colloquialisms and the sound of their voice.  As the patient’s voice begins to fade due to the progression of the disease, a function to enhance the voice is enabled, allowing the user to remain in communication with the world around them.  With the support of machine learning, it can even be used to support the loss of verbal fluency (forgetting words) that is common in PD.


## The impact

While experiencing a disease that causes loss of voice is never going to be pleasant, this solution could have a groundbreaking psychological impact as it means that the sufferer does not end up isolated in the last few months or years of their life.  Also, it lends itself to future innovations such as brain-computer interface (BCI), which could be leveraged to directly interface with the system.

For the moment, at the end of some of these diseases, it may not be possible anymore to read the signals from the patient.  At that point, the system can switch to more traditional methods involving alternative-input methods.  The learned voice synthesis, speech patterns and vocabulary can continue to be utilized allowing the person to speak with their own voice and words, keeping them part of the family and society.
